Aladdin dummy conventions include: - B Cusips (start with letter B, incremented, no meaning); - S Cusips are sometimes used for securities with SEDOLs: S plus SEDOL plus check-digit). - Futures Cusips use ticker plus maturity year plus check digit, e.g. TYH320039"

        description: "For active securities, this tag will not be present. For inactive securities, this tag will say INACTIVE. How it works: Security Master GUI has an Asset Status field. Usually it stores only values that mean ?inactive?; e.g., DELISTED, FUNGED, and EXCHANGED/CONVERTED. But sometimes it stores values that mean ?active.? The interface uses logic: If the Security Master GUI?s ?Asset Status? field (e.g. DELISTED) is in the decode (ASSET_STATUS) that lists all the inactive statuses, then ASSET_STATUS = INACTIVE. This sets all ?inactive? statuses (e.g. delisted, funged, converted, etc.) to INACTIVE; and it prevents any ?active? statuses from appearing"

Does not include capital flows (cash subscriptions and redemptions). Clients may consider using the Ledger Activity file 274 instead of this file, since Ledger Activity file uses cancel/correct methodology and contains cash from trades and from subs/reds."
